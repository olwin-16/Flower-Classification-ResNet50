# Flower_Image_Classification_using_ResNet50
I worked on a flower image classification project, where I utilized transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet50 model. This project strengthened my skills in applying deep learning for image classification tasks, which directly aligns with the work done at Fellowship AI.
